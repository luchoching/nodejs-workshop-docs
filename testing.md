# Testing

## Mocha, chai, istanbul

## Continuous Integration(CI)

the process of automatically building and running tests whenever a change is committed.

## Travis CI 

 it’s a Continuous Integration service that is free for open-source projects and has a monthly fee for closed-source projects based on how many simultaneous builds you want to run.

 Travis sets up “hooks” with GitHub to automatically run tests at specified times. By default, these are set up to run after a pull request is created or when code is pushed up to GitHub.

You will either need a static IP address or you need to map a DNS entry to your dynamic IP (for example with http://www.dnsdynamic.org). And you need to open the port 8080 for external access. Only then will GitHub be able to reach your local instance with its webhook.
